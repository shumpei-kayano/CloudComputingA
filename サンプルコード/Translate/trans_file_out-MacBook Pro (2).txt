Thank you very much for using our software.

The question you received is probably due to a different version of Python.


Is your environment Windows, or macOS or Linux?

Please use the “python” command for Windows, and the “python3” command for macOS and Linux.

If you use the “python” command on macOS or Linux, the software may not work as expected because Python 2 starts instead of Python 3.


We hope that the above measures will resolve the issue.

We would like to thank you for your continued use of our software in the future.
